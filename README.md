# Tiro
This is an application that is used to gamify azure devops sprints in order to improve team member productvity and software quality.

# About
The purpose of the project is to improve quality of user requirements, the velocity of a team throughout the sprint and having visibility and rewarding the team members that stick to agreed ways of working.

# Example Workflows
## Improve quality of business requirements 

As a product owner I want to capture the amount of reward money for a sprint so that I can show the importance and value of each sprint.

As a product owner I want to capture the definition of ready for a user story so that the quality of the user stories can be measured before the sprint start. e.g The user story must be written in the correct format. 2. The user story must have 4 to 5 acceptance criteria. The user story must have task that have story points.

As a product owner on the first day of the sprint I want to click the calculate reawards button so that the value I have specified can be shared accross requirements, development and testing.

As a system I want to calculate how much money the team has earned based on the quality of the user stories, acceptance criteria, tasks and story points.

## Improve velocity through out the sprint and not points getting burned 2 towards the end of the sprint

As a scrum master after the daily standup I must click the daily rewards button so that tokens are allocated to the team based on the closed user stories so that the team keeps a steady velocity throughout the sprint and not finish stories only towards the end of the sprint.

As a system I need to calculate the amount of story points that need to be burned each day so that it can be used to reward team members with tokens. 

The story can only be moved to closed by the product owner and that is the points can be earned.

## Motivate team members

As a system I must show a leader board of how the team members point allocations.

As a system I must show a dashboard of how point can be earned

As a system at the end of a sprint I must show show how much money was earned vs how much could have been earned and where the money was lost

## Deincetivise low quality software releases to QA

As a system I must slash points from a team member if the go above the agreed threthhold of bugs per story.

## Incentivise through software testing

As a system I must reward testers with points based on the amount of bugs they log.

As a system I must slash points from a tester if a bug is marked as a non issue.
