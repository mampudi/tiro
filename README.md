# Tiro
This is an application that is used to gamify azure devops sprints in order to improve team member productvity and software quality.

# About
The purpose of the project is to improve quality of user requirements, the velocity of a team throughout the sprint and having visibility and rewarding the team members that stick to agreed ways of working.

# Example Workflows
## Improve quality of business requirements 

At the beginning of the sprint there are points allocated to the sprint based on the value that the product owner thinks the sprint is worth. These token must have an actual value. 

On the start date of a sprint all stories have to have tasks and all tasks have to have points. If that is the case the teams earns points. Each story must have acceptance criteria and test cases. If that is the case the team earns points.

## Improve velocity through out the sprint and not points getting burned 2 towards the end of the sprint

The systems then calculates the velocity of points that need to be burned each day. If the teams burns that amount points are earned.

The story can only be moved to closed by the product owner and that is the points can be earned.

## Motivate team members

There is a leader board which shows teams members and calculates their velocity and a leader board. The team members that perform at the appropriate burn rate earn points daily.

The app must show what is the earning potential in each sprint. 

At the end of the sprint summarise how the sprint went bases on how many points where earned.

## Deincetivise low quality software releases to QA

There is slashing on team members based on the number of bugs logged.

## Incentivise through software testing

Team members who are allocated the role tester get points based on the number of bugs they log. If a bug the logged is marked as non issue they get slashed.
